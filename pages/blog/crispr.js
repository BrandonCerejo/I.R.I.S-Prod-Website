          The world of genetics has been completely transformed by a game changing 
breakthrough - CRISPR GENE EDITING. The 2012 revolution with CRISPR Shifed the ballooning 
world of genetics forever. Its applications in agriculture and medicine are nothing less than 
astounding. Because of the palindromic traits of CRISPR, it has taken Precison Focused 
Molecular Biology and other industries by storm as its capability to edit genes, manipulate and 
cut specific strands of DNA is unmatched. This makes me question, what does this mean for the 
future of science? I am sure you wish to know as well, so buckle up. Out of all technologies 
available, CRISPR is the most exciting considering the unimaginable results that gene editing can 
produce.

                                What&apos;s more astounding is the way it was discovered! The discovery of these clustered 
DNA sequences occurred independently in three different parts of the world. The first discovery was in 
1987 by Yoshizumi, a researcher at Osaka University. It was serendipityâ€”they 
accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the &quot;iap&quot; gene of *Escherichia coli* (a 
bacterium). 

The second discovery occurred in 1993. Two researchers studying *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* in the Netherlands 
observed diversity in its DNA sequences. 

The third discovery was by Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain. He studied the function 
of repeats in the archaeal species *Haloferax* and *Haloarcula*. Transcription of these interrupted 
repeats led to the first full characterization of CRISPR.

                                Do you know that Cas9 (or also known as &quot;CRISPR-associated protein 9&quot;) is an enzyme that 
opens up specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. For this, it 
uses the CRISPER sequence as a guide.   
              </p>

              <p>
                                Cas9 and CRISPR sequences is the basis of a  CRISPR-Cas9 that is used to edit genes within living 
organisms. The applications  include biological research, development of biotechnological 
products, and treatment of diseases.   
              </p>

                The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that cause mutations into the DNA. 
                These are: 
              </p>
              <ul>

                <li>An enzyme called Cas9, also known as a pair of &apos;molecular scissors&apos; that can cut the two 
                strands of DNA at a specific location. </li>
                <li>A piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA) which consists of a small piece of pre-designed RNA 
sequence (about 20 bases long) within a longer RNA scaffold. This sequence guides the Cas 9 to 
right part for the scaffold to  bind to the DNA.</li>
                <li>The Cas9 follows the guide RNA to the same location in the DNA sequence and makes a double 
                stranded cut across both strands of the DNA. </li>
                <li>At this stage the cell recognizes that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it.</li>
              </ul>

                             <p>
Therefore, the CRISPER Cas9 system works on the principle of homologous recombination, 
where two homologous chromosomes combine. The target sequence (complementary to the 
sgRNA sequence) is followed by two cytosine nucleotides because the sgRNA binds best when 
the opposite DNA strand is comprised of any nucleotide followed by two guanines (-NGG). This 
sequence is called a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence.

              In Conclusion, the development of this new tool was only possible due to the pioneering work 
of researching about the 2D structural and functional properties of Leptospira genomics.

                The birth of &quot;molecular scissors&quot; Cas9 and the system of guide RNA would soon enable     
biologists to make extremely precise alterations in the DNA strand of an organism. The 
introduction of genetic transformation and planting changed everything for humanity, 
agriculture, and medicine as areas previously defined by boundaries of science fiction were 
newly opened. Simulations of Cas9 have undoubtedly changed the notions tethering the future 
of genetic and therapeutic engineering.

                CRISPER is no doubt one of the most successful inventions for gene editing, which is itself a 
heroic cure for many uncurable diseases. What&apos;s more interesting is its discovery and its 
working!

              The invention of CRISPR, which now encompasses clustered DNA sequences, was nothing short 
of revolutionary for genetic studies in the world. The amazing finding of CRISPR-Cas9 stemmed 
from researchers working independently in Spain, Japan, and the Netherlands in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s.
